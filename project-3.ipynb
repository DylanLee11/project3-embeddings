Words like \"peaceful,\" \"focused,\" and \"relaxed\" have moved to different quadrants, suggesting that the underlying relationships between emotions in the embedding space vary. This may be due to differences in the training data, which could emphasize different contextual associations.

If you have multiple cars, I recommend finding a random university lot with meters a ways away from the stadium and parking any additional cars there (most metered university lots are free on weekends) and taking a bus back to the stadium for free. That way you only pay for the one car and can just pay $5 per guy for parking. \n",

The best options tho are likely Legends and Murphy's. They're both bars with food, and bar wise, much closer to a true bar while places like Kams or Lion are trying imitate more of nightclub vibes. Off campus tends to be where most people go out of college, specifically going to downtown Champaign. This is where the majority of good local resteraunts are at. There's a lot of good ones from Blackdog. Guidos, Esquire Lounge, etc. Plus I think 1-2 breweries are in there as well if you're into that. Never been to them tho. If you want more sitdown chain types of places, they're scattered throughout town, but mostly located on and around Prospect Ave, north of 74. That's where you'll find your Red Robins, Longhorn Steakhouse, BDubs, etc, and it's also where our Portillos is.\n",

The University has a hands-off policy as well, since this is all done by LLC companies, not publicly accountable agencies. The OP's plan to organize a class action lawsuit is a great idea, but local attorneys MIGHT be difficult to find to help out, because again...they are allied with local real estate interests. Consulting with UIUC's student legal services might be the key to change, but I hope the Illinois Attorney General's office gets involved: they have the power to sanction and fine these companies, and take legal action if necessary.

      "So, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in.

The counseling center’s purpose is to help students, but they can only accommodate a small amount of long term clients due to the size of the student body and the limited amount of counselors they have. They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management/referral service. If you are keeping all that in mind I think it’s worth trying out.

There was stuff in the apartment from previous residents that they did not clean out, a hair tie with hair on it, tons of used kitchen supplies. They said they could fix the ceiling and seemed to have thought painting over it was a good idea? I told them i need out of the lease as none of these things were mentioned and it leaves the apartment in unhealthy living conditions. They tried to make me pay the whole remainder of the rent for the lease or find someone to move in. I told them that as both me and my animals are sick and this is passing health code violations that I am not doing that and I am moving out immediately. They then asked me to at least pay for the next 2 months as well. I stated that I paid the first months rent when I didn’t even live there for longer than a month. I said I was paying for  them. They prey on tenants being uneducated about housing policies and genuinely have no care when they break those policies. I had given them a doctors note from a doctor stating that I was very clearly having symptoms of mold poisoning. DO NOT RENT FROM JSJ\n",

Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\n",

Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",

(Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

There are multiple subsets/parties within political zionism that outline ideologies on how to do that, just like there are multiple subsets/political parties within American democracy that outline how different groups think America should be run. Lumping all political zionists together as one monolithic group makes as much sense as saying all Americans have the same politics and aims. To say point blank that it’s ok to want any or all Zionist politicians/soldiers dead is just as nuts as saying it’s ok to want any or all American politicians/soldiers dead. Also, a two state solution would be a Zionist stance. \n",

      "Spiritual Zionism is part of Judaism because Judaism, the ethnoreligion, does not exist without the concept of Israel. Jews are a tribal people who originated from Israel and their religious practice is very much tied to the land. They pray facing Israel, their prayers are about Israel, their holidays incorporate plants indigenous to Israel and/or celebrate being in Israel/trying to get to Israel/defending Israel. Furthermore, Hebrew is part of Jewish culture (Jews use their Hebrew names in marriage certificates/ketubahs etc.) Spiritual Zionism is very much intertwined with the Jewish ethnic identity, and to stop being spiritually Zionist is to stop being Jewish. Spiritual Zionism has nothing to do with politics. I’d argue actually that the majority of American Jews know very little about political Zionism and historically haven’t paid much attention to the inner workings of a country half way around the world, but when they hear “Zionist” they automatically think “Jew” because of spiritual Zionism. \n",

As recently as this week they have shown maps showing their plans to seize the entire west bank for permanent Israeli settlement in full, and their language towards gaza has been of how to evict them so that israeli settlers can begin moving in.  That is practical, actual, in effect, real zionism in action.  That is what protesters are specifically talking about.

It is normal for definitions to change with time (Republicans love talking about how they were the party of Lincoln despite the modern Republican party aligning more with the Democratic Party of that era), and by 1949, political zionism shifted considerably. Modern Israel was formed not as an ethnostate, but as a multicultural and mostly secular state with the state religion being Judaism. It’s similar to any European Christian country with a state church but one that also has a diverse population and allows anyone to serve in government/have any occupation independent of religion or ethnic background. Israel is actually the most religiously diverse country in the region, despite ~70% being Jewish. That composition is not consistent with an ethnostate, which would be something like Japan, China, or even the population of Gaza which is >98% Sunni Muslim.

      "Your brand of zionism may be different than his.  But it is his that comes from the original usage in 1899 and it is his that is tangibly guiding military movements today and his that is currently sending bulldozers to the west bank to flatten Jenin, and it is his that protesters condemn when they chant against zionism.  I ask that you understand that it is more important to know what someone means by the word than to get hung up on the word itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fully understand this is all a problem for jewish people who wish for coexistence.  Bibi is attempting to conflate his version of zionism with all zionism and further with all judaism such that he and his supporters can call anyone who criticizes him antisemitic, that if you ask him to stop killing children he can say you hate jews.  It is their stated goal and why they are pushing so hard to redefine words in their favor.  There is a reason Israel is the only foreign nation where US states will pass laws banning people from NOT working with them.  Bibi's brand wants to conflate political ideology with ethnicity and religion until they are inextricable. The tangible effect of that also goes in reverse, now anti jewish racists of both the classic nazi variety and also the modern anti israel variety attack random jewish people because they see them as representative of bibi brand zionism even though they are not - which is complicated when Bibi's brand of zionism will claim that they are.  Conflating an ethnicity with a political state is one of the most racist things you can do and Bibi brand zionism does it to itself. Arabs and sikhs in the US are well aware of this post 9/11 when they were all seen as Al Qaeda terrorists by large amounts of the country, we have a decade of weirdly racist TV shows as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of bibi's influence, now they have convinced places like colleges all around the country that they need to treat any student who says \"free palestine\" as antisemitic lest they themselves as a university be seen as antisemitic.  I regularly see social media posts where someone is pinging a business, like an airline, trying to get a flight attendant wearing a palestinian flag pin fired for being antisemitic, some airlines have even bent to that pressure. It's a horrifying loop that US liberals are engaging in that plays directly into the hands of Bibi brand zionism and strengthens it, not weakens it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again.  If there is a word or phrase two different groups use differently.  You can't judge them for saying the word using your definition when they are using it for their definition.  Rather than fight over the semantics of what words are and aren't allowed at a protest, perhaps a better option is to actually engage with the protesters and what their goals are.    At this point 8/10 democrats want to stop sending weapons to Israel, I believe it may even be a majority of americans total.  Not because they are antisemitic, not because they support hamas, but because Bibi brand zionism is genocidal, and he is using the lives of jewish people who are not his brand of zionism as a shield to protect himself, and the protest movement wants him to stop and just like the protesters in tel aviv who got skunk gassed, they want a ceasefire now.  Bibi does not want a ceasefire.  Nobody has any leverage over him except Biden and american businesses.  So it is our job to find a way to make that pressure effective.  And tone policing antiwar protests rather than, you know, joining them until the war stops, is not going to be effective.\n",

The campus-wide Palestinian resistance movement had been growing for some time, and having received word of their impending Diag protest, the Zionist knew they had to act. This was their territory, and they would make that known. Just past the stroke of noon, a group of pro-Israel student militants led by Ron Weiser himself made their way to the Block M. They were at least two thousand in number, the blood of slaughtered children dripping from their uniforms as banners emblazoned with the Star of David flew overhead. But the protesters were not deterred. All 20 members of the TAHRIR coalition charged forward, flanked by their GEO allies. They threw watermelon slices at their foes until enough space had been cleared for a knitting circle. “Hey, hey, ho, ho - genocide must go!” they chanted, sitting down with their yarn. In that moment, Weiser knew he had met his match. The Zionists laid down their arms and listened intently as the members of the resistance conducted a slam poetry session on the evils of colonialism. The campus was secure, the day won. Rumor has it that Netanyahu was so moved by videos of the incident, he’s preparing a cease fire agreement that includes ceding the entirety of Israel to the Palestinians.\n",

The University also came under criticism and pressure from outside stakeholders.  On top of that, the Title VI investigation and settlement.

Trump does seem to be more blindly pro-Israel than Harris - but, even if you do genuinely believe they are both equal on the issue, I find it likely that, if you're pro-Palestine, you're also in support of other issues (such as abortion rights, and/or LGBTQIA+ rights, and/or freedom of speech and/or religion) that you're more likely to vote for Harris than Trump on. It also sounds like you voted in the Democratic primary, so I'm guessing you tend to vote more Democratic than Republican. If I'm right about any of this, meaning that you probably would have voted for Harris if not for her Israel-Palestine stance (which you think Trump is equally bad for), voting for nobody is essentially taking away a vote from Harris. It's not like neither of them will win as a result of your voting uncommitted - it's that Trump is ever so slightly more likely to win. And if you genuinely have no preference between the two of them, well, I disagree with you, but you'll at least be voting your conscience. But, if that's not the case, and you do have some slight preference for one candidate over the other, then your not voting is really just taking away a vote for the candidate that you'd like to win. Even if they do notice that a lot of people have voted uncommitted over Palestine, what then? Either Harris wins, in which case, if you're right that all she cares about is the votes, it doesn't matter whether or not you voted uncommitted - or, Trump wins, in which case Trump is president and also Harris has less direct power to take action over that issue, especially after January. Maybe, in four years, if she or someone else runs again, and if they're convinced by this election, and if the situation persists, they could take action on it then - but wouldn't things be even more irrevocable at that point?\n",

I also voted uncommitted because there was no candidate who stood a chance of winning that primary that I would be substantially more unhappy with than any other candidate. I will not vote uncommitted in the general election (which I also believe was the larger uncommitted voter movement's official stance at the time - I seem to remember them encouraging people to vote for Biden in the general election still over Trump, though I could well be misremembering). I will not vote uncommitted because I have the power to make it ever so slightly more likely that Harris becomes president instead of Trump, and I really, *really* do not want Trump to be president.\n",

I fully get the sentiment that politicians should be the ones who have to win over our votes, because that definitely *should* be the case. However, the fact is that my vote still holds some small amount of power; and, even if I wish Harris would have to work harder to earn my vote, the fact that she currently doesn't doesn't absolve me of any responsibility from how I'm voting, and whatever (admittedly small) amount of impact it can and will have.

If you open the floodgates to less qualified students, you either have to accept that there will be a lot of failing students or that the courses will need to be made less demanding. The former is terrible from the perspective of enabling your students to succeed, the latter is terrible because you now have less rigor and depth.\n",

Polling opened for the regents at approximately 3:40pm on Saturday, and was open for around an hour. After polls closed, no update was given on the process until around 5:20, when it was announced that votes were still being counted. The next update was at around 5:50, ten minutes before the convention was scheduled to end, where an announcer said that the votes had been counted, and now the calculations had begun (votes are weighted by county in a process that was not and has not been completely disclosed to the public). Around this time, there were reports of several cop cars around the convention center, and multiple cops came inside to “make sure delegates left peacefully after the results were announced”. Finally, the announcer came back out on stage over an hour later (and an hour after the convention had ended) and announced the final tallies for each candidate, said that Illitch and Diggs won, then hurried off backstage. There were indeed boos and chants after the results, however I left soon after the announcement, so I can’t personally speak to the nature of how the group left the center.\n",

These days, you would definitely have a better chance majoring in something you’re passionate about and enjoy, doing well in that, and then applying to med school with a more unique background rather than just bio or chem.

      "Under technical skills you don't list your proficiency. My assumption for new grads that list a bunch of languages and tools on their resume but do not list what proficiency, is you barely know how to use any of them and just put many things on your resume to seem impressive. Especially since you put things like Ubuntu, do you really know any software and/or tooling specific to Ubuntu and not other Linux distros? I bet not, so putting Ubuntu instead of Linux, paints the picture that you really aren't that familiar with Linux. Pretty much the same sentiment that you list with VS Code and Visual Studio. Most jobs really don't care what IDE or text editor you use unless they have a ton of specific scripting for those. Which I am assuming you really don't have an advance usage of those tools. Its also odd you list GCC on a different section than CMake, they should be grouped together. CMake is a build system, so I am not sure why it would not be in developer tools or why GCC. Are you really an advance user of GCC? If I had to guess you probably aren't familiar with the many different GCC extensions add versus what is ANSI C or ISO C++. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. This resume kind of screams master of game dev. Assuming you're not applying for game dev roles (and considering you've sent 700+ apps I assume not), this resume is still way too focused on game dev. It's unclear what roles you're targeting (backend/frontend/fullstack/ml/etc.) You don't have to have a speciality or anything, but a kind of broad direction is good. Fullstack + ML? Frontend? etc. This again is indicated by the projects you choose to display & the bullets you use to highlight exp. You have 2 game dev projects + bullets that kind of seem, all over the place? You have 1 frontend exp + 2 game dev + 1 AR + 2 game dev projects. I'm not really sure what to get from this. If you're not targeting game dev roles I would replace your projects and select your bullets for those exps better. For example, pioneered an accessible, flexible, game engine\" is a good first bullet because it's broad enough, but the rest are useless. \"Developed 2d+ shaders\", \"Implemented A\\* pathfinding\", \"Engineered a scalable, modular enemy wave system\", \"Created RPG, RTS, and Tower Defense templates\" are frankly not good bullet points if you're not game dev. If a role is hiring for Backend SWE I don't care about any of the above. You're highlighting the wrong parts of your experience. Did you work in a team? Use cloud services? Highlight other parts of what you did. Same goes with bunch of bullets under other exp.\n",
      "2. The other glaring issue is that your bullet points don't follow STAR. Firstly, I don't see a single metric/result/statistic anywhere in your resume which is definitely not helping you pass screens. Secondly, I don't see the point in some of your bullets. For example, \"Streamlined source control via Bitbucket while engaging in global communication and collaboration\" is a really weak bullet among several. Another example is, \"Created responsive particle systems for an immersive experience, consistently testing to ensure functionality\". This barely tells me anything, and \"consistently testing to ensure functionality\" is not really something to be highlighting in your resume either. I would suggest cutting this and replacing it with something else altogether, or even a stronger rephrasing might be something like \"Integrated responsive particle systems using React, Node.js, [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) to enhance user experience, resulting in 50% increase in interaction rates\" or something. You want all your bullets to follow the format of \"Developed \\[xyz\\] to accomplish \\[xyz\\] using \\[x, y, z\\], resulting in \\[xyz\\]\".\n",
      "3. Smaller nit, but the formatting of your technical skills is kind of janky. You should stick to 3 lines, and there's no need for Advanced/Beginner. I saw someone else tell you to list proficiency. This is just bad advice. Look at how Jake's resume does it for example, this is industry standard.\n",

The upcoming fall semester is also my 5th year (9th semester) at UMich. I am an international student who first came to UMich back in fall 2018. Up until first semester of sophomore year, I was maintaining 3.5 gpa, but during the winter 2020 semester when COVID happened, I was not able to focus on classes because of remote learning and ended up with multiple C's which were all luckily masked with P's, so no damage was done to my cgpa. Then I took 2 years of gap year to go back to my country for mandatory military service. I came back fall 2022 semester, but I was seriously burned out from serving and also getting back to an academic setting was very difficult transition for me. Although I was barely able to get above 3.00 gpa that semester, subsequent semesters I got below 3.00 gpa, and, ultimately, I got below 2.00 gpa the past winter semester, resulting in me being placed in academic probation. Back then, I would be upset with getting B's but now I don't really care even when I get C's and D's. I would also feel really anxious back then when I missed quizzes that didn't count towards final grades, but now I dont really give a shit about missing exams and quizzes (in fact I skipped all exams for one particular class and ended up with an E). I feel extremely devastated, and I have occasional lingering suicidal thoughts because of how much I screwed up college. I had nearly no friends throughout college and was never, ever socially active. I feel like crap when students around me are seemingly doing well academically and being active socially/making great college memories while I am stuck in my room most of the times not being able to focus on studying, wasting time on the internet, etc. My parents never know how much I am struggling in college, and I feel extemely guilty because they spent around $300k to send me here to study. I don't know how I can get out from this mess I've created and feel extremely angry/remorseful of all the wasted time and money the past six years. I hope you feel better and remember that there are worse people like me out there too. PM me if you want to talk to someone who's in the exact same but worse situatuon to you lol.\n",

One thing you can do is to do well in courses and work on technical skills needed for your research area of interest (in your case statistical programming in R or Python) and take core classes that are helpful to research areas you are interested in.

So if Social Work hires one of their student to be a GSI, they can't just say \"oh, we'll just waive your tuition & fees and not collect the revenue\" because it's not all their revenue to forego.  They'd be taking revenue away from student legal services, from Law, from LSA, each of whom aren't gaining anything from the hire.

      "Error processing text: TLDR: Yes, the GSI selection criteria is opaque and there can be politics involved. Yes, sometimes the students that work hardest do not get the position while for some the opportunity drops into their lap without much effort. For better or worse, the GSI system is the way it is because the skills needed for the position are not the same as the ones required for being a good student or researcher. Soft skills are be vital and for small courses having a pre-existing rapport with the instructor matter as it helps the course operate more smoothly. Finally, the GSI positions are never guaranteed unless you are a PhD student and being a GSI a necessity for your funding. As others pointed out, keep working hard and eventually your efforts will be rewarded whether it is a GSI position with tuition waiver, a high paying industry job, or a good post-doc/tenure track position that fits your interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For better or worse, the politics are a necessary component of the process as in smaller/advanced courses**, GSIs are mostly autonomous and design the labs on their own. An instructor needs to be able to get along with the GSI, trust in their abilities, and be able to rely on them during emergencies (ex: professor is sick and needs someone to teach a class under short notice). It is not uncommon to see a professors own students get GSI positions for their class as usually the research areas overlap (i.e., if a student is focusing on experimental design and working with a professor working on experimental design, they might be shortlisted and given preference to teach an experimental design course). Furthermore, some professors want to keep the same GSI for the course to make the process easy or reward hard work (example: GSIs that design labs for a course might be preferred to give the course consistency and reward hard work of the GSI)\n",
      "2. **Soft skills are as important as hard skills for GSI positions.** GSIs teach material, head discussions, grade assignments, and are usually required to communicate with students. Under these circumstances, sometimes soft skills can take precedence over hard skills. You might outperform your peers in courses, in your research, and other fields but if they are better communicators, especially verbal communicators, they might be chosen over you as a GSI since depending on the course, most of the position is communicating. This is another reason why not every researcher makes a good instructor and vice versa. Some people are naturally better at explaining complicated concepts simply or captivate a room full of students or not loose their temper when students ask the same question 1000th time in the same office hour instead of paying attention to other students' questions. These skills can be acquired through practice, but just like sports there are some who are natural at this.\n",
      "3.  (**I am not sure if the OP is a masters or a PhD student) GSI positions are not a right, they are a privilege unless you are PhD student**. In US universities master's programs are usually cash-cows where students pay for a education credential, this is in contrast with Europe where master's programs are usually research focused, akin to first 2 years of a PhD program in US. Since master's programs generate revenue, most programs do not give GSI positions to master's students if they can help it. (GSI=tuition waiver=loss of tuition revenue). PhD students already have their education paid for so a tuition waiver is not a loss of revenue and depending on the department, most PhD students are required to GSI for a set number of semesters per their funding offer. Some get fellowships and GSRA positions instead of GSI positions but most are required to GSI. The specifics change between fields and departments but the point stands that PhD students have priority for GSI positions and they also have 1-on-1 relationship with professors as their advisors, committee members, co-authors etc. as such will always be in a better place to snatch the open positions\n",

This makes going through the AMDP track a near necessity if you want to go forward with a quant position in the industry. Finally, like all other math tracks, the coursework can get time consuming and difficult at times with a lot of variance due to most courses (in the math department, not the electives/requirements from other departments) being taught by post-docs that are here for 2-3 years (I had one or two courses during my entire major that were from full time faculty, rest were all post-docs). \n",

      "  \n",
      "**TLDR:** Financial math is an amazing major that provides a solid foundation for quantitative finance and economics as well as statistics. The major works well with economics and statistics majors, giving you flexibility to pursue either of them as a secondary major (even both to triple major!). The major has nice exits in terms of AMDP programs or industry but the coursework is really theoretical so you need internships or other advanced courses to supplement yourself in terms of applied skills. Finally, the coursework can be difficult but if you put time and effort to it you can succeed! Just do not overload your schedule with 5 courses and a half time job like me and truly digest the material.\n",

The only exceptions to this is if you are legally emancipated, orphan, married I think, and a few other things. Getting a job will not impact the aid you get based on your parents income lol. You need to read up on this in the student aid website and look into it for yourself. There’s a reason why so many people have issues with financial aid especially for the students that have been very independent and supporting themselves through their low incomes but aren’t able to escape their parents income which is what their aid is evaluated by. So many kids are stuck in situations where their parents income holds them back from getting grants but the parents won’t support them even though they are the single defining factor for if they can afford school or not. And if this is the case for you, which it most likely is, I would look into getting better jobs off campus because the student employment typically doesn’t pay much.\n",

Yet, nowadays with the increases to minimum wages across the campus ($15/hour, usually more), the pay differential is not as good. \n",

If you have AP credit you can take Honors Statistic (STATS 280) or if you have AP credit plus Calc 3 (take it right away or dual enrollment credit), you can take STATS 412 or the STATS 425-426 sequence. In your case it will be either of 250 or 280 since stats is most likely a requirement for Pysch. Some majors have their version of introduction to statistics but courses like STATS 250 satisfy the requirement for all majors whereas majors specific ones usually do so only for that major as such you cannot go wrong with it.\n",
      "4. **After that, most people take other intro courses for their major** like  ECON 101-102 (again, AP credits do not satisfy the requirement, only IB does), Physics 1-2 sequence (barring AP credit), organic chemistry or general chemistry (depending on placement exam scores), intro to psychology, sociology, and other similar intro courses. In your case you have to find out if AP Psychology counts as Intro to psychology (as afformentioned, it doesn't do so for econ and stats) and take an intro course if it does not. \n",

These are all good classes to get done ASAP imo so it wouldn’t be bad to stick with it but you may find that you don’t have time for extra stuff that you might want to experience or become a part of your first semester. I think math 215 will make or break it, just depends on if things click well for you.\n",

Popov goes through slides very quickly and you basically have to learn most of it yourself outside of class.

Because that goes over my full need or total cost(I'm not sure which hence why you should contact the financial aid office), the financial aid office will remove some of the aid they gave to Match. Usually, they'll focus on removing 1k from your loans or work study first, then focus on their own university grants. Once done and the total aid matches, then you're pretty much done. \n",
